# Recursive Insertion Sort

> From CLRS - Exercises 2.3-5

```text
You can also think of insertion sort as a recursive algorithm. In order to
sort A[1 : n], recursively sort the subarray A[1 : n – 1] and then insert
A[n] into the sorted subarray A[1 : n – 1].
```

### Run

```bash
sh execute.sh
```
