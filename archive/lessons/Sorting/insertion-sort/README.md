# Insertion Sort

### Run code

- Sort in [increasing order](./insertion_sort_inc.cpp): `sh increasing.sh`
- Sort in [decreasing order](./insertion_sort_dec.cpp): `sh decreasing.sh`

### Notes:

- Time complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
- Insertion sort works best on small number of elements.
- Think of array as 2 arrays with initially just first element in left array and rest in the right array.
- It takes an element from right side and puts it at the correct index of left side.
- At all times left side of the array will be sorted.
