Algorithms Repo

This repo contains implementations of various algorithms and data structures in C. Every C file contains the implementation and unit tests for the same.

### Dependencies

- `gcc` - GNU Compiler Collection.
- [Criterion](https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion.git) - For unit testing.

> NOTE: C++, Java, Python, and other languages dependencies not mentioned here, because repo is being translated to C.

### Setup the C executor - `cexec`

```shell
sh setup.sh
```

> This installs a binary `cexec` which can be used to run any C program in this repo!

#### Usage

```shell
cexec <path to C file>
```

> This will run the unit tests in the C file
