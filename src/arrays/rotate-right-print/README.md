# Print array after it is right rotated K times

```txt
Given an Array of size N and a value K, around which we need to right rotate the
array. How do you quickly print the right rotated array?

Example:
Input: arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}, K = 2
Output: {7 9 1 3 5}
```

- Naive approach: [`rotate_right_print_naive.c`](./rotate_right_print_naive.c)
